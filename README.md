# Stock Prediction

## Description

This project aims to predict stock market movements using historical data from the S&P 500 index. By leveraging machine learning techniques, such as Random Forest classification, the notebook explores patterns in stock data to forecast potential trends.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Uses the `yfinance` library to fetch historical data for the S&P 500 index.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares data by removing unnecessary columns such as dividends and stock splits.
- **Model Implementation**: Employs a Random Forest Classifier to predict stock price movements.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Calculates precision scores to evaluate the model's effectiveness.

## File Structure

- `Stock Prediction.ipynb`: The main notebook containing all code, explanations, and results.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StockPrediction.git
   cd StockPrediction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Stock Prediction.ipynb"
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Fetch Data**:
   - Run the data collection cells to download S&P 500 historical data.

2. **Preprocess Data**:
   - Clean the data by removing unnecessary columns.

3. **Train Model**:
   - Implement and train the Random Forest Classifier on the preprocessed data.

4. **Evaluate Performance**:
   - Use precision scores to measure the model's accuracy and predictive capability.

## Dependencies

The following libraries are required:

- `yfinance`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
